    <h1 id=hi>Hey you!</h1>
    <h1 id=name>I'm Vanessa!</h1>

<div class="section">

<h2>My hometown</h2>

<p>I'm originally from Brazil, but I've been living in Canada as an immigrant for about two and a half years!</p>

<h2>What was I doing before RED?</h2>

<p>I've worked importing and exporting stuff over the globe. 
  Just right before joining RED, I worked for a shipping line which is one of container vessels companies you can often see berthed at the port of Vancouver.</p>

<h2>Interesting facts about me</h2>
  
<ul>
    <li>I hate ice cream ✘ </li>
    <li>I'm the crazy cat lady ♡</li>
    <li>I'm vegetarian Ⓥ </li>
</ul> 

<h2>My best travel experience, and why</h2>

<p>I'd like to believe my best travel experience is yet to come, but so far, memories from San Diego are sweet. 
    It was loads of fun, I've met awesome people and I got to be totally stress free.</p>

<h2>My secret talent</h2>

<p>I honestly don't have any talents, I mostly suck at cooking, snowboarding, dancing, playing the guitar, you name it. 
  But I usually make friends and learn relatively fast.</p>

<h2>My goals after I finish the program</h2>
    
<ol>
      <li>Enjoy my next job</li>
      <li>Live a happy life with a new career</li>
</ol>
