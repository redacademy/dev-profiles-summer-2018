        <h3>Before Red Academy</h3>
        <p>It has been over <strong>20 years</strong> since
         I was last in school getting my English Literature
         Degree so this is <em>definitely</em> a bit 
         daunting.
      <br>After graduating I worked for a variety of
          companies in Marketing and Sales in both Vancouver
          (my home town) and Victoria.
      <br>Now I want to get off that <a href= "https://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.istockphoto.com%2Fvectors%2Fcorporate-character-running-on-a-hamster-wheel-vector-id485426332%3Fk%3D6%26m%3D485426332%26s%3D612x612%26w%3D0%26h%3DxUvHQoWa-Nm7qFkwH6MBVe1u2_SPqb3GMZh_7WLBSF4%3D&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.istockphoto.com%2Fillustrations%2Fhamster-wheel&docid=t5mYJuHAy5IE7M&tbnid=BGGvylnJwwQwZM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjO6Z3C8PTbAhVwHzQIHYvzC4IQMwhnKAMwAw..i&w=612&h=612&bih=742&biw=1522&q=hamster%20wheel&ved=0ahUKEwjO6Z3C8PTbAhVwHzQIHYvzC4IQMwhnKAMwAw&iact=mrc&uact=8" target="blank"> wheel</a>
          and try something entirely new.
        </p>
        <h3>My Secret Talent</h3>
        <p>Ultra Anal Retentiveness and I am a Virgo - need
          I say more?

        <h3>After This Course</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Graduate!</li>
            <li>Get a job as a Front End Web Developer</li>
            <li>Work in an agency or freelance or both</li>
            <li>But mainly - get off the wheel and try something
                new</li>
