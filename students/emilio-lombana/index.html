        <h1>Life Before RED</h1>
        <h3>Hometown:
            <em>Langley, BC</em>
        </h3>
        <p>Before RED, I attended Brookswood Secondary. I was super excited to pursue<br/>web development
             as soon as I graduated, and now that i've made that happen,<br/> i'm here and ready to learn!</p>
             <h1>Interests</h1>
             <p>I like long walks on the beach, hanging out with friends, and partying!<br/> But I also find a good time in playing some music and relaxing at home.</p>
             <h1>An interesting fact about me.</h1>
             <p>Well, I can crack my neck really loud, it usually makes people cringe.<br/>
                 Also, I spend lots of my free time playing videogames.</p>
