        <h2> Where am I from?</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. You may know it by the NHL team, CALGARY FLAMES or by the 2 week cowboy gongshow put on every summer known as the CALGARY STAMPEDE.</p>
        <h3>What did I do?</h3>
          <p>Before I came to RED academy I worked with people with disabilities. 1 client named Glenn and another named Darrel. Both were great people they just needed a little help. We would go grocery shopping, play games, watch movies and go to any appointments or meetings they had. This was my job for the last 9 months and as much as I enjoyed it, everyday I would dream about being here at RED.</p>
        <h4>Where am I going? </h4>
          <p>The plan is to learn everything I can from RED and use all my new sweet skills to innovate anything and everything. The human race is way to smart and creative! We build tools and instruments that have created a world never seen before. My goal is to take these creations and innovate them in a way that allows humans total control over their potential.</p>

        <h6>One thing everyone should do in there life.</h6> 
        <p>Computers are everywhere and we use them everyday yet most people have no idea how to type without looking at the keyboard. I was just like most people until I enrolled for RED academy. I knew I would need to type like a boss if I were to even stand a chance. I found an awesome site to learn to type while having fun. Typingclub.com is the best way to learn typing and in todays world its somwthing everyone should have access to.</p>
