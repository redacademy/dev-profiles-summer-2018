        <div id="header3"><b><p>hey there</p></b></div>
        <p>my name is julia and i'm 24. i was born and raised in a small-ish town in brazil called nova firburgo, but i moved to vancouver ten years ago. i have a cat, a giant collection of oversized sweaters, and i'm on my second playthrough of the witcher
            3. i have probably watched the entirety of the office at least twelve times.</p>

        <ul class='main-list'>
            <li>taking naps</li>
            <li>browsing reddit</li>
            <li>drinking coffee</li>
            <li>watching horror movies</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <div id="header3"><b><p>i have a history degree</p></b></div>
    <p>well, actually, a history <i>and</i> a classics degree. i graduated from ubc in may, and i like to read and write a lot of historical fiction (favourite historical periods include pre-roman britain and anglo-saxon england). i would love to publish
        a novel one day.</p>

    <div id="header3"><b><p>i make a mean latte</p></b></div>
    <p>because i worked as a barista at a bunch of different coffee shops for many years. i just quit my job as an admin manager at a local chocolate company to focus on learning programming.</p>

    <div id="header3"><b><p>i went digging in sicily</p></b></div>
    <p>with a group of archaeologists two years ago! in a tiny place called gerace. we found a third century roman villa full of really cool intact mosaics, and on the weekends we did a lot of sightseeing and pizza-eating.</p>

    <div id="header3"><b><p>the future freaks me out</p></b></div>
    <p>but ideally i would love to work with data archiving or something similar -- you know, to help preserve bits and pieces of history. right now, though, i'm just focusing on getting decently good at this whole programming thing.</p>
